# OpusFilter

OpusFilter is a tool for filtering and combining parallel corpora.

Features:

* Corpus preprocessing pipelines configured with [YAML](https://yaml.org/)
* Simple downloading of parallel corpora from [OPUS](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) with [OpusTools](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/OpusTools)
* Implementations for many common text file operations on parallel files
* Memory-efficient processing of large files
* Implemented filters based e.g. on language identification, word aligment, n-gram language models, and multilingual sentence embeddings
* Extendable with your own filters written in Python

OpusFilter has been presented in [ACL 2020 system demonstrations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.20).

## Installing

Install the latest release from PyPI:

* `pip install opusfilter` or `pip install opusfilter[all]` (include optional Python libraries)

Install from source:

* `pip install .` or `python setup.py install`

### Troubleshooting

OpusFilter should generally work fine on Python 3.7 to 3.10. In the case of troubles, try installing the exact versions in `requirements.txt`:

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Documentation

The complete OpusFilter documentation is available from [helsinki-nlp.github.io/OpusFilter](https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/OpusFilter/).

You can also build the documents from the source:

* `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt` or  `pip install .[docs]`
* `sphinx-build docs docs-html`
